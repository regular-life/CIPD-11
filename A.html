                    <p class="faq-question">At what age should I purchase a Life Insurance Policy?</p>
                    <p>You should buy Life Insurance as soon as possible, and definitely as soon as you start earning. Buy when you are young so that your family's future is secure and you get insurance at a cheaper cost. In insurance-cum-investment plans, buying early also gives a greater chance for your wealth to grow.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Your payment term should depend on the financial goal for what you are saving for. For your child's education, the policy should mature when your child enters college. For a large goal like retirement, your payment term should be as long as possible, to enable you to maximize your savings to care of your non-working years.</p>

                    <p class="faq-question">What should I keep in mind while buying a child plan?</p>
                    <p>When you save for your child's education or marriage, make sure that: The policy has a 'waiver of premium' feature so that, in case of your death, the policy continues and your child's corpus grows undisturbed The Life Assured in the policy is the parent on whom the child is financially dependent. The policy continues until the child reaches the age when the funds are needed you should also consider a plan that gives you a monthly payout to help you pay regular education fees. There are plans in which guaranteed staggered payouts are given during the last 4 or 5 years of the policy to take care of a child’s professional education. So you do not have to worry about higher education fees at that juncture.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">Why should I pay my premiums on time?</p>
                    <p>Paying your premiums on time ensures that you enjoy all your policy benefits which would include life cover and the opportunity to create a corpus. Moreover, certain policies reward you for paying your premiums on time in the form of additions to your fund. These are added to your fund every time you pay your premium.</p>

                    <p>Yes. Saving Plans generally qualify for Section 80C benefits on premiums paid and Section 10(10D) exemptions on maturity amounts, provided certain conditions are met. Term Plans also offer similar tax benefits.</p>

                    Term Plans are pure protection life insurance products that provide a lump sum payout to the nominee in
                    the
                    event of the policyholder's death during the policy term. They do not provide maturity or survival
                    benefits
                    unless a Return of Premium feature is included. These plans are not intended for savings or investment
                    purposes and typically do not offer a surrender value.

                    Saving Plans are insurance products that offer a combination of life cover and long-term savings
                    benefits.
                    These plans may include guaranteed returns, bonuses, or investment-linked components, depending on the
                    plan
                    type. The maturity benefit is payable only if the policyholder survives the term and all premiums are
                    paid
                    on time. Early surrender of a Saving Plan may result in low or no returns, particularly in the early
                    policy
                    years. Certain plans include lock-in periods, after which partial withdrawals may be allowed.
