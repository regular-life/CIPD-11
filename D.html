        <summary>More on Saving Plans</summary>

        <p>The maturity benefit is payable only if the policyholder survives the term and all premiums are paid on time.</p>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
      
      <details>
        <summary>At what age should I purchase a Life Insurance Policy?</summary>
        <p>You should buy Life Insurance as soon as possible, and definitely as soon as you start earning. Buy when you are young so that your family's future is secure and you get insurance at a cheaper cost. In insurance-cum-investment plans, buying early also gives a greater chance for your wealth to grow.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>How should I decide the number of years for which to pay Life Insurance Premium?</summary>
        <p>Your payment term should depend on the financial goal for which you are saving.<br>
        For your child's education, the policy should mature when your child enters college.<br>
        For a large goal like retirement, your payment term should be as long as possible, to enable you to maximize your savings for your non-working years.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>What are the various charges in a Life Insurance Policy?</summary>
        <p>The Government has defined the various charges that could be there in a Life Insurance policy, along with a maximum limit for each. <br>
        Please refer to your policy documents or plan brochures for further details.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>Are premiums fixed for the entire term?</summary>
        <p>Yes, once you buy a Term Plan, your premium remains fixed throughout the policy term, provided you pay on time and don’t change your plan features.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>What should I keep in mind while buying a child plan?</summary>
        <p>When you save for your child's education or marriage, make sure that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The policy has a <span class="tooltip">'waiver of premium'
              <span class="tooltiptext">In case of your death, the policy continues and your child's corpus grows undisturbed.</span>
            </span> feature</li>
          <li>The Life Assured in the policy is the parent on whom the child is financially dependent</li>
          <li>The policy continues until the child reaches the age when the funds are needed</li>
          <li>You should also consider a plan that gives you a monthly payout to help you pay regular education fees</li>
          <li>There are plans in which guaranteed staggered payouts are given during the last 4 or 5 years of the policy to take care of a child’s professional education</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So you do not have to worry about higher education fees at that juncture.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>Why should I pay my premiums on time?</summary>
        <p>Paying your premiums on time ensures that you enjoy all your policy benefits, which include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Life cover</li>
          <li>Opportunity to create a corpus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moreover, certain policies reward you for paying your premiums on time in the form of additions to your fund.These are added to your fund every time you pay your premium.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>Do Saving Plans offer tax benefits?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Saving Plans generally qualify for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Section 80C benefits on premiums paid</li>
          <li>Section 10(10D) exemptions on maturity amounts, provided certain conditions are met</li>
          <li>Term Plans also offer similar tax benefits.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>Can I choose the renewal payment date as per my convenience?</summary>
        <p>Yes, Canara HSBC Life Insurance provides you the flexibility of choosing a renewal payment date. <br>
        You can select any one date (5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, or 25th) for your premium payment by submitting a fresh NACH/ SI mandate. <br>
        This option is not available in monthly mode cases.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>Do Saving or Term Plans require medical tests?</summary>
        <p>Term Plans require medical tests, especially for higher coverage amounts or applicants above a certain age. <br>
        Some Saving Plans offer “no medical test” options for low-value plans or younger applicants.</p>
