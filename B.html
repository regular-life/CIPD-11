                    <p class="faq-question">At what age should I purchase a Life Insurance Policy?</p>
                    <p>
                        You should buy Life Insurance as soon as possible, and definitely as soon as you start earning.
                        Buy when you are young so that your family's future is secure and you get insurance at a cheaper
                        cost. In insurance-cum-investment plans, buying early also gives a greater chance for your
                        wealth to grow.

                    <p class="faq-question">How should I decide the number of years for which to pay Life Insurance
                        Premium?</p>
                    <p>
                        Your payment term should depend on the financial goal for which you are saving. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>For your child's education,</b> the policy should mature when your child enters college.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>For retirement,</b> your payment term should be as long as possible to maximize your
                            savings for non-working years.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="faq-question">What are the various charges in a Life Insurance Policy?</p>
                    <p>
                        The Government has defined the various charges that could be included in a Life Insurance
                        policy, along with a maximum limit for each. Please refer to your policy documents or plan
                        brochures for further details.

                    <p class="faq-question">Are premiums fixed for the entire term?</p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, once you buy a Term Plan, your premium remains fixed throughout the policy term, provided
                        you pay on time and don’t change your plan features.

                    <p>
                        When saving for your child's education or marriage, make sure that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>The policy has a 'waiver of premium' feature</b> so that, in case of your death, the
                            policy continues and your child's corpus grows undisturbed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The Life Assured in the policy</b> is the parent on whom the child is financially
                            dependent.

                            <b>The policy continues until the child reaches the age</b> when the funds are needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Consider a plan that provides a monthly payout</b> to help you pay for regular education

                            <b>Guaranteed staggered payouts</b> may be available during the last 4–5 years of the policy

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">Why should I pay my premiums on time?</p>
                    <p>
                        Paying your premiums on time ensures that you enjoy all your policy benefits, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Life cover</b></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, certain policies reward you for timely payments with additions to your fund every time
                        you pay your premium.

                    <p class="faq-question">Do Saving Plans offer tax benefits?</p>
                    <p>
                        Yes. Saving Plans generally qualify for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>
                        Term Plans also offer similar tax benefits.

                    Saving Plans are insurance products that offer a combination of life cover and long-term savings
                    benefits. These plans may include:

                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>The maturity benefit is payable only if the policyholder survives the term and all premiums are paid
                on time.</h3>
                <p>⚠️ Early surrender of a Saving Plan may result in low or no returns, particularly in
                    the early policy years. Certain plans include lock-in periods after which partial withdrawals may be
                    allowed.
